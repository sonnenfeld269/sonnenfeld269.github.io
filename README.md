# Introduction

This is my project that I created during a wonderful udacity class. It is a front-end portfolio site showing my projects.
The moste important files are:
  * **index.html**: This file represents the html structur of our portfolio.
  * **/css**: Inside this folder you will find our styling sheet. The custom styles are defined in **style.css**.
  * **/js**: Inside this folder you will find our javascript files.
    * **portfolio.js**: Here are some jquery functions that will be called to animate our index.html
    * **data.js**: This is our little database, where the data is stored inside a json array.
    * **inject.js**: This class takes the data from data.js and injects it into html. That way the projects overview and the project modal windows are created dynamically.
  * **/images**: Here you will find all the images which are on the website.
